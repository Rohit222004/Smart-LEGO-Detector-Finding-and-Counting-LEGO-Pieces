🧱 Smart LEGO Detector: Finding and Counting LEGO Pieces
This project uses computer vision to automatically detect, count, and identify LEGO pieces from images. It helps streamline sorting tasks and can be adapted for inventory or educational purposes.

🎯 Project Overview
The main objective was to build a system that can:

Detect LEGO bricks from an image using OpenCV.

Count the number of distinct pieces.

Highlight and label each piece visually.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

OpenCV (Contour detection, Morphological operations)

NumPy

Matplotlib (for image visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Key Features
Preprocessing techniques like thresholding and blurring for clear detection.

Contour-based segmentation to isolate individual LEGO pieces.

Real-time object counting and annotation on images.

Easily extendable to color or shape classification.
